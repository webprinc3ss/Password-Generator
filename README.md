# Password Generator

## Purpose
This project is a random password generator wherein the user is prompted to choose the length (between 8 - 128 characters) and the type of characters one would like to include.  If the user does not choose the proper criteria, they will be promoted to try again.

I was given the template.  The project needed JavaScript in order to work properly.
